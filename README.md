# Convolutional-Neural-Networks_MNIST_dataset_image_classification
In this project I predict the value of a handwritten digit, using the very popular MNIST dataset - a collection of 70,000 grayscale handwritten numbers between 0 and 9.

The steps I performed are:

Acquiring and exploring the dataset
Splitting the dataset in train / validation / test partitions
Implementing a neural network
Writing a training loop
Visualising our results
Improving the model
